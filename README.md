# Cabinet Installation Operation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of cabinet installation productivity in a multi-floor dormitory construction. The study focuses on workflow management, crew efficiency, tool utilization, and recommendations for improvement.

## Project Details
- **Project Name:** Cabinet Installation - College View Apartments
- **Project Type:** Student Housing
- **Units:** 90 (1,2,3, and 4 BHK with amenities)
- **Total Size:** 170,503 sq. ft.
- **Location:** San Diego, CA
- **Construction Company:** Morley Builders (Benchmark Contractors, Inc.)
- **Project Start:** December 2021
- **Expected Completion:** August 2024

## Installation Process
### **Preparation Phase**
- Cabinets are pre-assembled in a warehouse before delivery.
- Materials are delivered one day prior to installation.
- Extra cabinetry is stored to prevent delays due to damage.

### **Installation Phase**
- Crew consists of 5 individuals (two teams of two plus one floating helper).
- Each crew handles 3-4 units per day.
- Key tools used: drilling equipment, saws, tape measures, and battery chargers.
- Innovative techniques, such as using wooden supports for upper cabinet installation, enhance efficiency.

### **Quality Assurance**
- Workers ensure precision and alignment in cabinet placement.
- Workflow improvements, such as reducing unnecessary measurements, are implemented to save time.

## Performance & Productivity Analysis
- **Total cycle time per cabinet:** 25.17 minutes
- **Optimized cycle time:** 14.81 minutes (after workflow improvements)
- **Time saved per day:** 62 minutes by reducing unnecessary tasks
- **Key optimizations:**
  - Standardized measurement and labeling system
  - Prefabrication of components
  - Investment in digital measurement tools
  - Task sequencing and optimized crew allocation

## Recommendations
- Implement a standardized labeling system to reduce non-productive time.
- Prefabricate and pre-assemble cabinetry to minimize on-site work.
- Use digital measurement tools to enhance accuracy and efficiency.
- Optimize task sequencing and assign skilled workers to complex tasks.

By following these recommendations, the efficiency of cabinet installation can be significantly improved, contributing to the overall success of the construction project.
